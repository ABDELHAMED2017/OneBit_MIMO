## Notes:

1)  Our simulation platform is revised from the Studer's simulator provided by "Quantized Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO", which is  avaible at https://github.com/quantizedmassivemimo/1bit_precoding; We have updated the proposed prcoder (ADMM_Leo--v2.m); Interested readers can directly add the file (ADMM_Leo--v2.m) into the Studer's simulator for performance comparasion; 

2)   If SDR-based precoders are employed for comparasion, you should establish CVX which is avaliable at http://cvxr.com/cvx/;


3)   If you use our codes, please cite our paper; Chu L, Wen F, Li L, et al. Efficient Nonlinear Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO Downlink Systems with 1-Bit DACs[J]. 2018. Avaliable at arXiv:1804.08839;


4)   If you get any question for our codes, please contact: leochu@sjtu.edu.cn;


5)   We are appreciated for Dr. Studer from Cornell University for the discussions for setting the paramters in SQUID preocder in the case of small size MU-MIMO.
