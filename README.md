## Notes:

(1)  Our simulation platform is revised from the Studer's simulator provided by "Quantized Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO", which is  avaible at https://github.com/quantizedmassivemimo/1bit_precoding; We have updated the proposed prcoder (ADMM_Leo--v2.m); Interested readers can directly add the file (ADMM_Leo--v2.m) into the Studer's simulator for performance comparasion; The lastest verison of the proposed precoder can support MU-MIMO with multi-bit DACs;


(2)  If SDR-based precoders are employed for comparasion, you should establish CVX which is avaliable at http://cvxr.com/cvx/;

(5)  We are appreciated for Dr. Studer from Cornell University for the discussions for setting the paramters in SQUID preocder in the case of small size MU-MIMO.
