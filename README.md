## Notes:

(1)  Our code is modified from the code provided by "S. Jacobsson, G. Durisi, M. Coldrey, T. Goldstein, and C. Studer, Quantized Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO, IEEE Transactions on
Communications, 2017", which is available at at https://github.com/quantizedmassivemimo/1bit\_precoding.
Some codes of Jacobsson are directly copied here to facilitate the ease of use
for interested readers who want to reproducing the results in our paper.
We have updated the proposed precoder (ADMM\_Leo--v2.m).
We greatly appreciate for the authors "S. Jacobsson, G. Durisi, M. Coldrey, T. Goldstein, and C. Studer" for providing
fundamental simulation platform and benchmark precoders (e.g., MRT, ZF, WF, SDR and SQUID).


(2)  If SDR-based precoders are employed for comparasion, you should establish CVX which is avaliable at http://cvxr.com/cvx/;
